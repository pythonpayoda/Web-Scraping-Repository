If a liquidity facility is deemed to be an ""eligible"" facility, the bank may use a 10 percent conversion factor, when converting the unused portion of the facility to an on-balance sheet credit risk equivalent amount.  The letter clarifies how the asset quality test for eligibility should be applied when the underlying assets contain equity securities.  Because the 90 days past due criterion is not applicable to an equity security, an alternative asset quality test was needed when the liquidity facility covers a conduit that contains margin loans on equity securities.   Specifically, as long as the margin loans that might be purchased at par under the provisions of the liquidity facility are over-collateralized by at least 25 percent, the liquidity facility will be an eligible facility.
