Approvals with conditions enforceable under 12 	U.S.C. 1818 ,1114,int1114.pdf,"Letter describes the appropriate risk-based capital treatment for three types of exposures of national banks (NBs), which are members of the ICE US Trust, LLC (ICE Trust), a credit-default swap clearinghouse. ICE Trust, which is a member of the Federal Reserve System and subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, serves as a central counterparty for the purpose of clearing certain credit-default swap (CDS) transactions between members, some of which are NBs. As a result of their dealings with ICE Trust, these NBs will have three types of exposures: (1) counterparty creditexposure arising from cleared CDS transactions; (2) exposures from margin posted as collateral for the transactions; and (3) exposure from a required contribution to the clearinghouse guarantee fund.  Due to the regulated nature of ICE Trust and other prudential factors, the acc has determined that the risk-based capital treatment provided under the risk-based capital rules does not appropriately reflect the risks of transactions with ICE Trust. Therefore, the acc has determined to use its reservation of authority at 12 CFR § 3A(b) to apply a 20% risk weight to these three types of exposures. The OCC believes that a 20 % risk weight more appropriately reflects the risk associated with these exposures.  05/06/2009"

If a liquidity facility is deemed to be an ""eligible"" facility, the bank may use a 10 percent conversion factor, when converting the unused portion of the facility to an on-balance sheet credit risk equivalent amount.  The letter clarifies how the asset quality test for eligibility should be applied when the underlying assets contain equity securities.  Because the 90 days past due criterion is not applicable to an equity security, an alternative asset quality test was needed when the liquidity facility covers a conduit that contains margin loans on equity securities.   Specifically, as long as the margin loans that might be purchased at par under the provisions of the liquidity facility are over-collateralized by at least 25 percent, the liquidity facility will be an eligible facility.   05/11/2007"
