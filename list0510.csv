2010-16,cd10-16.pdf,"Letter describes the appropriate risk-based capital treatment for three types of exposures of national banks (NBs), which are members of the ICE US Trust, LLC (ICE Trust), a credit-default swap clearinghouse. ICE Trust, which is a member of the Federal Reserve System and subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, serves as a central counterparty for the purpose of clearing certain credit-default swap (CDS) transactions between members, some of which are NBs. As a result of their dealings with ICE Trust, these NBs will have three types of exposures: (1) counterparty creditexposure arising from cleared CDS transactions; (2) exposures from margin posted as collateral for the transactions; and (3) exposure from a required contribution to the clearinghouse guarantee fund.  Due to the regulated nature of ICE Trust and other prudential factors, the acc has determined that the risk-based capital treatment provided under the risk-based capital rules does not appropriately reflect the risks of transactions with ICE Trust. Therefore, the acc has determined to use its reservation of authority at 12 CFR § 3A(b) to apply a 20% risk weight to these three types of exposures. The OCC believes that a 20 % risk weight more appropriately reflects the risk associated with these exposures.  05/06/2009Application to charter Deposit Insurance National Bank of Greeley, Greeley,  Colorado, under 12 USC 1821(m),  to assume the insured deposits of New Frontier Bank, Greeley, Colorado, an insured bank in default, and to perform other activities  (Control Number 2009 WO 01 0006), 04/10/2009 "
